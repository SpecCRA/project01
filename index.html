            A website is like a house where <b>HTML files</b> are the <em>structure</em> providing information such as where rooms, what kind of rooms, and how many rooms you have. <b>CSS</b> is your <em>design</em>. This may show what color everything is or what shameful posters you hang up. <b>Javascript</b> controls the <em>interactive units</em> of your website. This would be analogous to your garage door opener or shower.

          <p>
            Chrome has developer tools within the browser to show you the HTML and CSS of a website. It visualizes each part of code and highlights specific elements to their corresponding parts of the website. This also shows you the tree-like structure inside each block element. You can use this to see how others organize their code to do front end web development.

            CSS is what changes the style of a website. This changes things such as font sizes, colors, positioning of blocks, and many others. The most specific rules are applied to every child element. A selector choose which element your styles will be applied too. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">This page</a> is a good reference for CSS selectors and how they work.

It basically is what allows blocks to be next to one another. Normally, div blocks take up the entire line in a webpage. After you adjust for size, flex box overrides the positioning of your elements.
